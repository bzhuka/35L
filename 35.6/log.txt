First I typed "ifconfig" to figure out my ip address.
I typed
   "sudo apt-get update" to update my apt.
Then I typed
   "sudo apt-get install openssh-server".
To create an account for the client, I typed
   "sudo useradd -d /home/asdf -m asdf"
To create a password I typed:
   "sudo passwd asdf",
then when prompted I typed "asdf".
Then I created a .ssh directory for asdf by navigating then making it.
   "cd /home/asdf"
   "sudo mkdir .ssh"
I then changed ownership and permission on the .ssh directory.
   "sudo chown -R asdf .ssh"
   "sudo chmod 700 .ssh"
I sent my ip, username, and password to my partner, Xinyu Yang, and he logged
on and made a file.  I went back to my computer, used "ls", and saw it.

Next I had to connect to him with:
"ssh yxy@10.97.85.31", and typed "yes" for the unidentified fingerprint, and
typed in his password.
Once in, I typed "touch new", and when he checked, he saw it.

I exited the ssh then navigated back into "/home/asdf" and generated a public
and private key.
    "ssh-keygen"
I copied my public key to the server for key-based authentication
   "ssh-copy-id -i yxy@10.97.85.31"
Then added a private key to the authentication agent:
   "ssh-add"
Then my partner sshed into it, and it didn't ask for any password.
I tried to ssh into my partner, and it also didn't ask for any password.
   "ssh -X yxy@10.97.85.31"
I ran xterm and it worked.
