1. Brady removed "case_long_iso_time_style:" because it was duplicated.  He
   had a switch statement, and by having it twice there and having it once
   there it wouldn't make a difference.  It also wasn't necessary to remove
   it.  Brady was just cleaning up the code, but it made no difference to
   the actual result of running the code.

2. People unaccustomed to the traditional UNIX date might be confused initially
   Also people living in other countries might not format their dates in the
   right way.  In addition, programs might be built expecting the purely
   numerical format.  If not updated, those programs wouldn't work correctly
   anymore as the output is now different.

3. When this script is invoked on an empty file it raises an IndexError.
   "IndexError: list index out of range"
   This happens because randline can't process an empty file.  In line 275
   when the variable seq is empty, then it raises the error.

4. When called using Python 3 rather than Python 2, it raises an IOError.
   File "randline.py", line 65
       except IOError as (errno, strerror):
   Python 3 and Python 2 have different syntax, so obviously it doesn't work.
