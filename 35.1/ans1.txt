1.  You use man -k to "search for the specified string in *all* man pages."  
    I used man man to find it.
2.  The cp program is located at /bin/cp and the wc program is located at
    /usr/bin/wc.  I used which to find them.
3.  Using find /usr/bin -name ?, I found X, w, and [.  /usr/bin/X runs the X
    Window System according to man X.  Running /usr/bin/w gives me a list of
    logged in users and information including USER, TTY, FROM, LOGIN@, IDLE, 
    JCPU, PCPU, WHAT.  Accoring to man [[], [ is a bash builtin.
4.  It is actually executing /etc/alternatives/emacs. I used ls -la to find it.
5.  g+s means that all users in the file's group will gain the ability to set
    user or group id on execution.  o-x means you are removing the execute right
    from users in the other category.  I used man chmod to find it.
6.  The option of find you would use is -mtime -21 according to man find.
7.  To find my results I typed "find / -type d -mtime -21 2>/dev/null". 
     Some results I got back were
    /bin, /u/be/ugrad, /u/bm/class, /u/cs/grad, /var/lib/yum,
    /usr/libexec/git-core, and /usr/share/wallpapers/EOS.
8.  20
    find is in /bin (I used which find). Then I used ls -la and counted.
9.  The oldest file is libgamin-1.so.0.1.10 according to ls -lat.
10.  According to man locale, it gets data from the LC_* environment variables
     including LC_TYPE, LC_COLLATE, LC_TIME, LC_NUMERIC, LC_MONETARY, and 
     LC_MESSAGES.
11.  Buffer-menu-sort, Buffer-menu-sort-by-colum, ibuffer-invert-sorting,
     ibuffer-toggle-sorting-mode, rmail-sort-by-author, 
     rmail-sort-by-correspondent, rmail-sort-by-date, rmail-sort-by-labels,
     rmail-sort-by-lines, rmail-sort-by-recipient, rmail-sort-by-subject,
     sort-columns, sort-fields, sort-lines, sort-numeric-fields, sort-pages,
     sort-paragraphs, sort-regexp-fields.
     I found them all using C-h a sort*
12.  I found this using C-h b and C-h k
     C-M-a beginning-of-defun - Move backward to the beginning of a defun.
     C-M-b backward-sexp - Move backward across one balanced expression.
     C-M-c exit-recursive-edit - exit from the innermost recursive edit.
     C-M-d down-list - Move forward down one level of parentheses.
     C-M-e end-of-defun	- Move forward to next end of defun.
     C-M-f forward-sexp - Move forward across one balanced expression.
     C-M-h mark-defun - Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.
13.  After running C-h k C-g, it says: "C-g runs the command keyboard-quit,
     which is an interactive compiled Lisp function.  During execution of Lisp
     code, this character causes a quit directly. At top-level, as an editor
     command, this simply beeps."  Basically it quits your current command, 
     including partially typed ones.
14.  The Emac function yank brings back the last "killed" text. It's kind of 
     like paste.  I found it while reading through the Emac tutorial found
     by pressing C-h t.
15.  The directory listing of the Emacs dired command shows hidden files.  
     Other than that, they both give the same information.
