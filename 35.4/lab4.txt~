1.  To get a copy of the Diffutils repository in the Git format, I typed
    "git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils" which created a clone of the
    repository in a directory called gitroot that I made for this lab.

2.  Navigating into diffutils, I put git-log into a textfile named git-log.txt
    by typing "git log > git-log.txt".

3.  I typed "git tag > git-tags.txt.

4.  To find it I typed "git log --all --grep='Maint: quote' > quote-patch.txt".

5.  I typed "git checkout v3.0"

6.  I tried to patch it but it said my patch file was garbage.  Then I found
    the commit identity which was "62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f".
    I used "git format-patch -1 --stdout <commit> > quote-patch.txt".

    To patch it I tried typing "patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt".
    I had some patches that I skipped.

7.  It showed us what we modified.
    HEAD detached at v3.0
    Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

9.  I started opening each of the files above and using the command C-x v u.
    After every vc-revert it asked
    "Discard changes in /u/cs/ugrad/bradleyz/gitroot2/diffutils/insertfile?"
    I asked my TA and he said to type yes because we are discarding them.
    For the .c files I used C-x v = to open vc-diff.  Then I searched through
    it looking for changes and I manually changed the quotes back that were
    inside comments.  To revert back the hunks I want, I typed C-c C-a.

10. I typed "emacs src/*.c.rej".  I ended up opening diff.c.rej and
    diff3.c.rej.

11. The untracked files were these:
    NEWS.orig
    README-hacking.orig
    README-hacking.rej
    README.orig
    README.rej
    cfg.mk.orig
    cfg.mk.rej
    git-log.txt
    git-tags.txt
    ms/config.site.orig
    quote-patch.txt
    src/cmp.c.orig
    src/context.c.orig
    src/diff.c.orig
    src/diff.c.rej
    src/diff.h.orig
    src/diff3.c.orig
    src/diff3.c.rej
    src/dir.c.orig
    src/sdiff.c.orig
    src/system.h.orig
    src/util.c.orig
    tests/help-version.orig

    To remove them all I just typed "rm insertfilename".

12. Now git status displays:
    	modified:   src/cmp.c
    	modified:   src/diff.c
    	modified:   src/diff3.c
    	modified:   src/dir.c
    	modified:   src/sdiff.c
    	modified:   src/util.c
    I then typed "git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt".

13. The README-hacking file said that The first step (skipping the CVS part)
    was to do "./bootstrap" in order to get the other files needed to build,
    which are extracted from other source packages.  The next steps were to
    "./configure", "make", and "make check".  At this point there should be no
    difference between the local copy and the master.  As a test,
    "cvs diff -pu" should output no difference.
    "diff . -” outputted: "diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory"
    One sample line from "diff --help":
    "FILES are 'FILE1 FILE2' or 'DIR1 DIR2' or 'DIR FILE...' or 'FILE... DIR'."
    Both examples have ' rather than ` as the left quotes.

14. I moved to the original diffutil's source folder, then copied everything to
    a directory I made called diffutils-3.0 using "cp * ~/w4/diffutils-3.0".
    Then I moved to the modified version's source code and did the same thing.
    I then moved to the git and ran
“src/diff -pru ~/w4/diffutils-3.0 ~/w4/diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt”

15.  I typed "diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt".  There were many
     differences, and the differences were not innocuous.
