First I generated a file of 10,000,000 random double-precision floating point
numbers with one per line.  I ran:
  "od -An -f -N 8000000 < /dev/urandom | tr -s '''\n' > random.txt"
Then I went and deleted the empty line and the start.
To time sort I typed:
  "time -p sort -g --parallel=2 random.txt> /dev/null"
And I got:
  real 9.56
  user 18.00
  sys 0.05

1 Thread:
  real 17.72
  user 17.69
  sys 0.03

2 Threads:
  real 9.56

4 Threads:
  real 5.90
  user 18.96
  sys 0.05

8 Threads:
  real 4.83
  user 22.32
  sys 0.09

The CPU tme goes up with more threads, because it's the sum of the CPU times of
all the threads used.  Real time goes down.
